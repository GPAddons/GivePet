## GivePet

A GriefPrevention addon allowing players to transfer pets.

## Installation

GivePet is a plugin like any other, it just requires GriefPrevention! Install GriefPrevention and
GivePet into your plugins folder.

## Usage
`/givepet <player>` or `/transferpet <player>`:
 * Offer someone a pet!
   * Target must be online, visible, mutually not ignored with GriefPrevention, and have permission to accept or decline.
 * Permission: `givepet.give`
 * If a version of GriefPrevention is installed that features `/givepet`, GriefPrevention's
   version will take precedence. This can be worked around with an
   [alias](https://github.com/Jikoo/OpenInv/wiki/Customizing-Aliases#setting-up-an-alias).

`/acceptpet`:
 * Accept a pet!
 * Permission: `givepet.receive`

`/declinepet`:
 * Decline a pet!
 * Permission: `givepet.receive`
